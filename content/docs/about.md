Aotearoa New Zealand is home to a number of forest birds that live nowhere else on Earth. Aotearoa has a real thing for birds, as shown by the popularity of the annual [Bird of the Year](https://www.birdoftheyear.org.nz/) competition run by the national charity, [Forest & Bird](https://www.forestandbird.org.nz/).

Many birds in Aotearoa are flightless, very long-lived, and have slow breeding rates, as well as small clutch sizes and large eggs. Several species are nocturnal, and others have a large body size. All these features have contributed to their extinction or decline.
