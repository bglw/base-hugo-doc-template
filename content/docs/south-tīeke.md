The **South Island saddleback** or **tīeke** (_Philesturnus carunculatus_) is a forest [bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird) in the [New Zealand wattlebird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callaeidae) family which is [endemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(ecology)) to the [South Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Island) of [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand). Both the [North Island saddleback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Island_saddleback) and this species were formerly considered conspecific. The [Department of Conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Conservation_(New_Zealand)) currently has the South Island saddleback listed as _At Risk--Declining_.

Distribution and habitat
----------------------------

During the early 19th century, South Island saddlebacks were widely distributed throughout the South and [Stewart Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Island). However, by the end of the century, the species was in decline and nearing extinction due to introduced predators. By 1905, the saddlebacks were confined to the South Cape Islands, off the coast of Stewart Island. In 1962, [ship rats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rattus_rattus) were introduced to [Big South Cape Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taukihepa_/_Big_South_Cape_Island), causing the extinction of the [greater short-tailed bat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_short-tailed_bat), [Stewart Island snipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Island_snipe) and the [Stead's bush wren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushwren).

In early 1964, 36 individuals on Big South Cape Island were translocated by the [New Zealand Wildlife Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Wildlife_Service) to pest-free islands. Big Island received 21 individuals, whilst Kaimohu Island received 15. Further translocations and predator removal allowed the population to recover, with the current population estimated to be around 2000.

Behaviour and ecology
-------------------------

### Threats

The South Island saddleback is at risk of outbreaks of [avian malaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_malaria) and [avian pox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_pox) - two outbreaks in 2002 and 2007 resulted in high mortality rates among those infected. Saddlebacks are especially vulnerable as they have had limited exposure to avian malaria, due to the disease's relatively short history in New Zealand.

Conservation
----------------

A threatened species recovery plan was established by the Department of Conservation in 1994, with the aims of maintaining wild populations, adopting quarantine procedures, and removing predators from islands potentially suitable for translocating members of the species.
