The **South Island kōkako** (_Callaeas cinereus_) is a possibly extinct forest bird [endemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(ecology)) to the [South Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Island) of [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand). Unlike its close relative, the [North Island kōkako](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Island_k%C5%8Dkako) (_C. wilsoni_), it has largely orange wattles, with only a small patch of blue at the base, and was also known as the **orange-wattled crow** (though it was not a [corvid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvidae)). The last accepted sighting in 2007 was the first considered genuine since 1967, although there have been several other unauthenticated reports.

Taxonomy
------------

The kōkako was first described by German naturalist [Johann Friedrich Gmelin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Friedrich_Gmelin) in 1788 as _Glaucopis cinerea,_ from the [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin) _cinereus_ ("grey"). For some time the North Island and South Island birds were considered subspecies of _Callaeas cinerea_, but since 2001 North Island birds have been officially recognised as _C. wilsoni_, and genetic evidence confirms their difference. Although the genus _Callaeas_ is masculine, the [species epithet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_name_(zoology)) _cinerea_ is not masculinised to match, though some authors have argued it should be.

Description
---------------

Like the North Island kōkako, this was a slate-grey bird with long legs and a small black mask; [Reischek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Reischek) considered its plumage slightly lighter than the North Island species. Its wattles were distinctly orange in colour with a dark blue base; young birds had much lighter wattles. It seems to have spent more time on the ground than the North Island species, but been a better flier. Kōkako have distinctive organ- and flute-like duetting calls. Early explorer [Charlie Douglas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Douglas) described the South Island kōkako call: "Their notes are very few, but the sweetest and most mellow toned I ever heard a bird produce." Based on extant records, South Island kōkako eggs were larger than their North Island counterparts.

Distribution
----------------

At the time of European settlement, South Island kōkako were found on the West Coast from [northwest Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North-west_Nelson_Forest_Park) to [Fiordland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiordland), as well as [Stewart Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Island), [Banks Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banks_Peninsula), and the [Catlins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Catlins). Subfossil bones suggest they were formerly found throughout the South Island, but forest burning by [Polynesians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynesians) eliminated them from dry eastern lowland forest. Introduced mammalian predators and forest clearance by settlers reduced their numbers further: by 1900 the bird was uncommon in the South Island and Stewart Island, and had almost disappeared by 1960. Its vulnerability compared to the North Island species was perhaps due to its foraging and nesting close to the ground.

Conservation status
-----------------------

The South Island kōkako was formally declared extinct by the [Department of Conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Conservation_(New_Zealand)) in 2007, as it had been 40 years since the last authenticated sighting at [Mt Aspiring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Aspiring_/_Tititea) in 1967. In November 2013, however, the [Ornithological Society of New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornithological_Society_of_New_Zealand) accepted as genuine a reported sighting by two people near [Reefton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reefton) in 2007, and changed the bird's [New Zealand Threat Classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Threat_Classification_System) status from "extinct" to "data deficient". Eleven other sightings from 1990 to 2008 were considered to be only "possible" or "probable".

A supposed kōkako feather was found in 1995, but examination by scientists at the [National Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_New_Zealand_Te_Papa_Tongarewa) showed it to be from a [blackbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_blackbird), though doubt over this conclusion exists due to the morphology of the feather and the identity of the feather used for the DNA test. Unconfirmed sightings of South Island kōkako and reports of calls have continued, but no authenticated recent remains, feathers, droppings, video, or photographs exist. The [IUCN Red List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List) status of the species is, as of 2016, Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct). The most recent unconfirmed sighting was in November 2018, in the [Heaphy Track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaphy_Track) in [Kahurangi National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahurangi_National_Park). A potential kōkako [call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_vocalization), consisting of a "a distinct couple of soft long notes" was recorded at Heaphy Track on 29 December 2021, followed by a sighting of "a bird of the right size and colour".
