The **New Zealand quail** (_Coturnix novaezelandiae_), or _**koreke**_ in [Māori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_language), is an [extinct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinct) [quail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quail) species [endemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic) to [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand). The male and female were similar, except the female was lighter. The first scientist to describe it was [Sir Joseph Banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Banks) when he visited New Zealand on [James Cook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cook)'s first voyage. Terrestrial and temperate, this species inhabited lowland tussock grassland and open fernlands. The first specimen to be obtained by a European was collected in 1827 by [Jean René Constant Quoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Ren%C3%A9_Constant_Quoy) and [Joseph Paul Gaimard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Paul_Gaimard) on [Dumont D'Urville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumont_D%27Urville)'s voyage.

History
-----------

Research was conducted between 2007 and 2009 into whether the quails on [Tiritiri Matangi Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiritiri_Matangi_Island) – which was spared the worst impact of [introduced predators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species) – might be a surviving population of this species, or _koreke_\-[brown quail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_quail) (_Synoicus ypsilophora_) [hybrids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)). However, a genetic study showed instead that the quail on Tiritiri Matangi are Australian brown quail, _Synoicus ypsilophora_. Sequences were derived for all quail species within the Australian and New Zealand _Coturnix sp_. complex.

Taxonomy
------------

It has sometimes been considered [conspecific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspecific) with the [Australian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia) [stubble quail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stubble_quail) _Coturnix pectoralis_, which would then be named _Coturnix novaezelandiae pectoralis_ as the New Zealand bird was described first. However, the genetic analysis showed that they are separate though closely related species.
