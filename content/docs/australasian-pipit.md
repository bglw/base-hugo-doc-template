The **Australasian pipit** (_Anthus novaeseelandiae_) is a fairly small [passerine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine) [bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird) of open country in [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia), [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand) and [New Guinea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea). It belongs to the [pipit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipit) genus _Anthus_ in the family [Motacillidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motacillidae).

It was formerly lumped together with the [Richard's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard%27s_pipit), [African](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_pipit), [Mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_pipit) and [Paddyfield pipits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddyfield_pipit) in a single species: Richard's pipit, _Anthus novaeseelandiae_. Some authors split the Australasian pipit further into two species: **Australian pipit** (_Anthus australis_) in Australia and New Guinea and **New Zealand pipit** (_Anthus novaeseelandiae_), also called **pihoihoi**, in New Zealand.

Description
---------------

It is a slender bird, 16 to 19 cm long, and weighs about 40 grams. The [plumage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage) is pale brown above with dark streaks. The underparts are pale with streaks on the breast. There is a pale stripe over the eye and dark [malar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheek) and moustachial stripes. The long tail has white outer-feathers and is often wagged up and down. The legs are long and pinkish-brown while the [bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak) is slender and brownish.

It has a sparrow-like _chirruping_ call and a drawn-out _tswee_ call.

Ecology
-----------

It is a bird of open [habitats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat) such as grassland, farmland, roadsides, dry river beds, sand dunes and open woodland. It forages on the ground for small [invertebrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrates) such as [beetles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beetle), [spiders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider) and [insect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect) [larvae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larva). It will also eat [seeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed) such as those of [grasses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass).

The breeding season begins in August. The [cup-shaped nest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cup_nest) is placed at the base of vegetation or in the shelter of a stone. It is made of grass and built by the female. Two to five [eggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_egg) are laid, three or four being most common. They are buff-white with brown blotching and are [incubated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation) for 14 to 15 days. The young birds are fed by both parents and are able to fly after 14 to 16 days.

The birds' numbers have declined in parts of New Zealand due to the improvement of [pastures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasture), use of [pesticides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide) and predation by [introduced species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduced_species).
