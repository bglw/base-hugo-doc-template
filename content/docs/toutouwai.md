The **North Island robin** (_Petroica longipes_) is a species of [Australasian robin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroicidae) [endemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism) to the [North Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Island) of [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand). It is also known in [Māori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_language) as the **Toutouwai**. It and the [South Island robin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Island_robin) (_P. australis_) of the [South Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Island) and [Stewart Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Island) were once considered conspecific (and called the "New Zealand robin"), but [mitochondrial DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_DNA) sequences have shown that the two lineages split prior to the [Pleistocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene), and support the classification as two different species.

Description
---------------

The [plumage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage) is dark grey-black overall, with a pale area (smaller than that of the South Island robin) on the belly and breast, and pale streaking on the upperparts. They are [sexually dimorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism), with males having darker plumage than the females and being slightly larger.

Distribution and habitat
----------------------------

The North Island robin is distributed mostly in the centre of the North Island, with small [relict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relict) populations in the north and south, on Moturua Island in the [Bay of Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Islands), [Little Barrier Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Barrier_Island), and [Kapiti Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapiti_Island). Populations have been reestablished in the [Zealandia sanctuary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zealandia_(wildlife_sanctuary)) in Wellington, and at [Moehau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moehau) on the [Coromandel Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coromandel_Peninsula). A remnant population is also reestablishing itself in the Ōhope Scenic Reserve, near [Whakatāne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whakat%C4%81ne); 40 birds were translocated to the reserve from [Mokoia Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mokoia_Island) to assist the population there.

Their natural habitat is mostly native forest, particularly _[Podocarpus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podocarpus)_ and southern beech ([Nothofagaceae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothofagaceae)) forests, from sea level up to the tree-line.

Behaviour
-------------

### Feeding

The North Island robin, like the South Island robin, is a terrestrial feeder foraging on or near the ground (unlike the related and more arboreal [tomtit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomtit)). Prey items are located by perch-hunting, where an individual waits at an elevated perch until prey is spotted, or by active searching; prey is taken from the leaf-litter, low vegetation (branches and foliage), and tree trunks. Numerous [invertebrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrate) prey are taken, including [cicadas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicada), [earthworms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthworm), [wētā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C4%93t%C4%81), snails, and spiders. Fruit is also taken. North Island robins cache food supplies for later when prey is plentiful, although males cache more food than females do. Both sexes will steal food from their mate's cache, and are less likely to cache food, if their mate is present.
