The **Campbell shag** (_**Leucocarbo campbelli**_), also known as the **Campbell Island shag**, is a species of [bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird) in the family [Phalacrocoracidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalacrocoracidae). It is [endemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism) to [Campbell Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_Island,_New_Zealand). Its natural [habitats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat) are open [seas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea) and rocky shores. It is a medium-sized [bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird), around 63 cm in length, with a wingspan of 105 cm, weighing between 1.6 – 2 kg. They only breed on [Campbell Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_Island,_New_Zealand) and forage within 10 km of the island. Its unique, looped head and elongated beak allows to easily feed on shellfish and marine invertebrates. This is done through foraging dive cycles of high speed and efficiency.

Some taxonomic authorities, including the [International Ornithologists' Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Ornithologists%27_Union), place this species in the genus [Leucocarbo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucocarbo). Others place it in the genus [Phalacrocorax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalacrocorax).
