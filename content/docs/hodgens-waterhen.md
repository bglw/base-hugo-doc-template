**Hodgens' waterhen** (_Tribonyx hodgenorum_) is an extinct [rail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rallidae) species from [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand). Its name commemorates the Hodgen brothers who were owners of the [Pyramid Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_Valley) swamp where the [holotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holotype) was discovered. It reached a weight of 280 g and its wings were so reduced that it was unable to fly. It occupied a wide range of habitats, including open forest and grassland along riverbanks.

History
-----------

_Tribonyx hodgenorum_ was closely related to the black-tailed native-hen (_[Tribonyx ventralis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribonyx_ventralis)_) and the Tasmanian native-hen (_[Tribonyx mortierii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribonyx_mortierii)_). The species was first described by [Ron Scarlett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Scarlett) as _Rallus hodgeni_ in 1955. [Storrs L. Olson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storrs_L._Olson) transferred it into the genus _[Gallinula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallinula)_ in 1975 and changed its specific epithet to _hodgenorum_ in 1986. It is only known from [subfossil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subfossil) material of which the youngest [MƒÅori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_people) [midden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midden) record is from the 18th century. Hundreds of bones have been unearthed at [Pyramid Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_Valley) in the [South Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Island), at [Lake Poukawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Poukawa) in the [North Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Island), and several other sites, indicating that it was once widespread in New Zealand except on the [Chatham Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_Islands). The main reasons for its extinction are likely to have been predation by the [Pacific rat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_rat) and hunting by human settlers.
