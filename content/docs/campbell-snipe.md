The **Campbell snipe** (_**Coenocorypha aucklandica perseverance**_), also known as the **Campbell Island snipe**, is a rare [subspecies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies) of the [Subantarctic snipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subantarctic_snipe), [endemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism) to [Campbell Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_Island,_New_Zealand), a [subantarctic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subantarctic) island south of [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand) in the [Southern Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ocean). It was not formally described until January 2010. The subspecific name alludes to the name of the [sealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_hunting) [brig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brig) _Perseverance_, captained by [Frederick Hasselborough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Hasselborough), that discovered Campbell Island in 1810, and which probably inadvertently introduced [rats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Rat) to the island when it was [wrecked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipwreck) there in 1828.

History
-----------

The existence of the Campbell snipe was unknown until 1997 when, during a search for the [Campbell teal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_teal), there was the chance discovery of a small population on an almost inaccessible rock, [Jacquemart Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacquemart_Island). Thus there is not much information about it and it remains one of the least known birds in the world.

[Austral snipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austral_snipe) are extinct on the mainland of New Zealand but continue to survive on several subantarctic islands. A naturalist landed on Campbell island in 1840 and whilst there found no birds to be present: all endemic land birds had been destroyed by rats from shipwrecks in the area (in the mid-19th century). By 2001 the rats on Campbell Island had been eradicated (the largest eradication of rats as a conservation effort in the world) and it was hoped that the snipe would naturally return to their original home.

In 2006 BDG Synthesis funded a search effort on Campbell Island. Snipe expert Dr Colin Miskelly, and James Fraser with a snipe dog, surveyed the island for snipe to see if they had re-established on the main island. They also intended to acquire DNA for analysis and comparison with the extinct mainland species. The snipe had already re-established with a population of about 30 individuals. This news was greeted with relief as it was thought that the species would have to be re-introduced from Jacquemart Island through human intervention. However, no intervention has been necessary as the snipe are naturally repopulating the 11,000-hectare pest-free island.
