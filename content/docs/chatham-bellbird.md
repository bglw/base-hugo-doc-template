The **Chatham bellbird** (_**Anthornis melanocephala**_) is an [extinct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinct) species of [bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird) in the family [Meliphagidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meliphagidae). It was [endemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism) to the [Chatham Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_Islands).

In appearance it was very similar to the [New Zealand bellbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_bellbird) (_Anthornis melanura_) but was considerably larger. Also the whole of the head and neck was brightly glossed in purplish or steel-blue.

It was last observed in 1906 on [Little Mangere Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Mangere_Island). The population was likely impacted by the introduction of a disease as there was a sudden population decline before the onset of other disturbances such as rats, cats and specimen collectors.
