The **North Island takahē** ([Māori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_language): _moho_) (_Porphyrio mantelli_) is an [extinct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinct) [rail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rallidae) that was found in the [North Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Island) of [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand). This flightless species is known from subfossils from a number of archeological sites and from one possible 1894 record (Phillipps, 1959). It appeared to have been even larger than the [South Island takahē](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takah%C4%93) and, if it did survive until the 1890s, would have been the largest rail in historic times. The decline of the species has generally been attributed to the increasing incursion of forest into the alpine grasslands through the [Holocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene), although hunting by the [Māori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_people) also played a major role.

Traditionally the North Island takahē was considered [conspecific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspecific) with the [endangered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered) South Island takahē _P. hochstetteri_. Trewick (1996) presented evidence that the two taxa were independently derived from flying ancestors, so proved to be separate species.

The binomial of this bird commemorates the naturalist and civil servant [Walter Mantell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Mantell).
