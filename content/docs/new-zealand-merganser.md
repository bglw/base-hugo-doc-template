The **New Zealand merganser**, **Auckland merganser** or **Auckland Islands merganser** (_Mergus australis_) was a [typical merganser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mergus) which is now extinct.

Description
---------------

This duck was similar in size to the [red-breasted merganser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-breasted_merganser) (_Mergus serrator_). The adult male had a dark reddish-brown head, crest and neck, with bluish black mantle and tail and slate grey wings. The female was slightly smaller with a shorter crest.

History
-----------

This bird was first collected when a French expedition led by the explorer [Jules Dumont d'Urville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Dumont_d%27Urville) on the ships _L'Astrolabe_ and _La Zelee_ visited the [Auckland Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland_Islands) in 1840. Its decline was caused by a combination of hunting and predation by introduced [mammals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal). The bird was not flightless, but rather hard to flush; it preferred to hide between rocks when pursued. The last sighting was of a pair shot on January 9, 1902. It was not found in a 1909 search, and a thorough 1972/1973 exploration of possible habitat concluded that it was long extinct (Williams & Weller, 1974).

Subsequent fossil discoveries suggest that this merganser was previously resident in the [South Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Island), and on [Stewart Island/Rakiura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Island/Rakiura) in [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand). Fossils of a subspecies or closely related species have also been found on the [Chatham Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_Islands). There exists a short remark mentioning "a merganser" found on [Campbell Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_Island,_New_Zealand) in McCormick (1842), but this may just as well refer to the semi-marine [Campbell teal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_teal) which is otherwise missing in his notes: he only mentions the [Pacific black duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_black_duck) ("a New Zealand species of duck").
