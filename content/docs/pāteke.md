The **brown teal** (_Anas chlorotis_; [Māori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_language): _pāteke_) is a [species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species) of [dabbling duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dabbling_duck) of the genus _[Anas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anas)_ native to New Zealand. For many years it had been considered to be [conspecific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspecific) with the flightless [Auckland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland_teal) and [Campbell teals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_teal) in _Anas aucklandica_; the name "brown teal" has also been largely applied to that entire [taxon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxon). Common in the early years of European colonisation, the "brown duck" (as it had been often referred to) was heavily harvested as a food source. Its numbers quickly fell, especially in the South Island, and in 1921 they became fully protected. Captive breeding and releasing into predator-controlled areas has seen good localised populations re-introduced around the country in recent years.

Description
---------------

There are no distinctive differences between a male, female and a juvenile brown teal during non-mating season. They all have a white ring around their eyes as well as a mottled brown color on their heads and throat. During breeding season the male will begin to change color, now having a green colored head, chestnut colored breast and a white stripe on each side of their body. They will sometimes also have a white clerical neck band. This does vary as some males do tend to be more colorful than others.

Taxonomy
------------

Pateke is the progenitor of the flightless [Auckland teal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland_teal) and [Campbell teals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_teal) but all are now recognised as separate species on account of their geographic isolation and their plumage, size and genetic distinctions. The insular _A. aucklandica_ and _A. nesiotis_ are recognised as good species, but are still sometimes referred to as being part of the "brown teal group". The use of the name 'pateke' is now common and is specific for this particular species.

Concerns have been raised about establishing genetically similar populations during re-introduction. The original captive pateke were sourced from Great Barrier Island, where only one [haplotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplotype) was found in abundance, compared with eleven haplotypes found in the other remaining population at Mimiwhangata. The newly released flocks exclusively contain these birds of captive origin, and diversity is perhaps now not being fully represented in the National population.

The former population of Fiordland brown teal, which died out by 2013 has been replaced with captive-origin birds. Sequencing showed striking similarity to grey duck and mallard sequences, with which they group. It therefore seems extremely likely that the former Fiordland population of brown teal have at sometime in the past hybridised extensively with these invading species

Behaviour
-------------

The brown teal is largely [nocturnal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnal) in habit by dabbling duck standards. This is an [evolutionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution) response to natural [diurnal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diurnality) predators such as the [New Zealand falcon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_falcon), [Eyles' harrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyles%27_harrier), or [skuas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skua) further south in their range. Brown teal have no defense against introduced cats, dogs, stoats & ferrets, which can kill adults & ducklings, or against rats which eat eggs.

Diet
--------

It feeds by dabbling and upending, like its relatives. Its diet consists mainly of [aquatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_animal) [invertebrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrate) like [insects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect) and their larvae, or [crustaceans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean). It appears quite fond of [mollusks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mollusk). Small species such as pipi (_[Paphies australis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paphies_australis)_) and large wedge shell (_[Macomona liliana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macomona_liliana)_) are eaten whole and crushed in the gizzard. For feeding on larger [cockles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockle_(bivalve)) such as _[Austrovenus stutchburyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrovenus_stutchburyi)_ (New Zealand cockle), at least some New Zealand teals have developed a peculiar technique, as of now undocumented in other birds, to force their rather soft bills between the cockle shells and tear out the flesh with a [jackhammer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackhammer)\-like pumping motion. At night brown teal will forage on land some distance from the streams used as a refuge during the day (Worthy 2002).

Breeding
------------

Nest of dry grass near water or under shelter of large _[Carex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carex)_, heavily lined with down. A clutch of four to eight creamy-brown eggs is laid. Incubation is done by only the female and takes 27–30 days. The male stays in his territory as a guard, aggressive to all other waterfowl.

Distribution & conservation
-------------------------------

This species is endangered and occurs predominantly on offshore islands but also in predator-proof sanctuaries on the mainland such as [Tawharanui Regional Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tawharanui_Regional_Park). Formerly, it was widespread on the New Zealand mainland, but it disappeared there due to introduced [predators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predator) like cats, dogs and rats, which easily preyed on this unwary, weakly flying bird. According to the [IUCN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN) categorization as **VU D1**, fewer than 1000 adult birds remain. The species has recently been upgraded to [endangered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species) by [Birdlife International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birdlife_International) (Birdlife 2007), and the change will be reflected in the next update of the IUCN red list.
