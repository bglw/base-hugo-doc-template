The **Chatham snipe** or **Chatham Island snipe** (_**Coenocorypha pusilla**_) is a species of [wader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wader) in the family [Scolopacidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scolopacidae). It is [endemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic) to the [Chatham Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_Islands) of [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand), and is only found on a few islands in the south of the Chatham Islands group.

Its natural [habitats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat) are temperate [forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest) and temperate [grassland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassland).

Chatham snipe feed by probing into the ground in search of worms, amphipods, insects and larvae.

Scientific discovery
------------------------

In 1868 the Chatham snipe was collected by naturalist  and was sent to ornithologist [Walter Buller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Buller) who described it as a new species of snipe. On an exploratory mission to the islands in 1871, [Henry Travers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_H._Travers) only found the snipe on [Mangere Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangere_Island). Attempts to return snipe to main Chatham Island would be hampered by the presence of introduced mammals and of [weka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weka), which are predators of snipe chicks.
