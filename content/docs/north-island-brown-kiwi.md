The **North Island brown kiwi** (_**Apteryx mantelli**_; _Apteryx australis_ or _Apteryx bulleri_ as before 2000, still used in some sources) is a species of [kiwi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiwi_(bird)) that is widespread in the northern two-thirds of the [North Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Island) of [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand) and, with about 35,000 remaining, it is the most common kiwi. It holds the world record for laying the largest eggs relative to its body size.

Genetics
------------

The genome of _Apteryx mantelli_ was sequenced in 2015.

Taxonomy
------------

Until 2000, the brown kiwi (then _Apteryx australis_) was thought to include the [rowi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowi) and the [tokoeka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokoeka), in addition to the North Island brown kiwi. However using genetic codes from each of the above it was determined that the tokoeka was a separate species, it took the _Apteryx australis_ name, leaving the brown kiwi with its current _Apteryx mantelli_ name. Soon after, in 1998, more [genetic tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_phylogeny) were done with the rowi and it was determined that it (the rowi) was a separate species (_Apteryx rowi_). In 2004 an injured bird was found with streaked white around the head and identified by Massey University. The white feathering is likely due to a rarely seen genetic variation sometimes described as a partial albino. Few documented cases exist with only a painting of one found in [Otorohanga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otorohanga) in the 18th century and a specimen in the [Canterbury Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury_Museum,_Christchurch). The injured bird recovered and was introduced into a breeding programme.

The brown kiwi was first described as _Apteryx australis_ by [Abraham Dee Bartlett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Dee_Bartlett), in 1813, based on a specimen from [Dusky Sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusky_Sound), [South Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Island), New Zealand. This is a monotypic species.

Range and habitat
---------------------

Brown kiwi are found in a number of parts of the [North Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Island), including Northland, [Coromandel Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coromandel_Peninsula), the eastern North Island, [Aroha Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aroha_Island), [Little Barrier Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Barrier_Island), [Kawau Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawau_Island), [Ponui Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponui_Island), and the [Whanganui Region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanganui_(district),_New_Zealand). The North Island brown kiwi has demonstrated a remarkable resilience: it has adapted to live on scrub-like farm land, exotic pine plantations, and native forests, but it prefers dense [sub-tropical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-tropical) and [temperate forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate_forest).

Description
---------------

Females stand about 40 cm (16 in) high and weigh about 2.8 kg (6.2 lb) the males about 2.2 kg (4.9 lb). The [plumage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage) is streaky red-brown and spiky. The North Island brown kiwi is the only species of kiwi found internationally in zoos.\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)_\]

Behaviour
-------------

These kiwi, like all kiwi, feed on [invertebrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrates). They have 2-3 [clutches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_(eggs)) a year with 2 eggs in each clutch. Chicks are fully feathered at hatching and are [precocial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precociality), being able to leave the nest and fend for themselves within a week.

Conservation
----------------

The North Island brown kiwi is [Vulnerable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species), per the [IUCN Red List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List), with the major threat coming from predators, such as dogs, cats, and [stoat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoat) (_Mustela erminea_). 94% of chicks die before breeding in areas where mammalian pest control is not carried out. It has an occurrence range of 38,400 km2 (14,800 sq mi), with a population, estimated in 2000, of 35,000.

In 1996 there were around 35,000 North Island Brown Kiwis and in 2006 there were 20,000. 

Nationwide studies show that on average only 5 percent of kiwi chicks survive to adulthood. However, in areas under active pest management, survival rates for North Island brown kiwi can be far higher. For example, prior to a joint [1080 poison operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080_usage_in_New_Zealand) undertaken by DOC and the [Animal Health Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Health_Board_(New_Zealand)) in [Tongariro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongariro) Forest in 2006, 32 kiwi chicks were radio-tagged. 57% of the radio-tagged chicks survived to adulthood. Thanks to ongoing pest control, the adult kiwi population at Tongariro has almost doubled since 1998.\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)_\]
