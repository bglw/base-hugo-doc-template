The **Auckland rail** (_Lewinia muelleri_) is a small nearly flightless [rail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rallidae) [endemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism) to the [Auckland Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland_Islands) 460Â km south of [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand). It is somewhat of a [biogeographical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogeography) anomaly, being the only species in the genus _[Lewinia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewinia)_ to have reached the islands of New Zealand, skipping over\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)_\] the main islands to reach the remote Auckland group. Its closest relative is [Lewin's rail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewin%27s_rail) of [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia). The species is currently restricted to two islands in the Auckland group, [Adams Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adams_Island,_New_Zealand) and [Disappointment Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappointment_Island).

The Auckland rail is a small rail with chestnut back [plumage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage) and a grey breast. The flanks are barred black and white and the head is red-brown, with a red [bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak). It is smaller than the Australian Lewins' rail. There are conflicting reports about its ability to fly. Early accounts suggested it could; recent researchers have found little evidence for this. If the species is able to fly, it does so very infrequently. Auckland rails have a variety of [calls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_song), the most common being a _crex_ call made at one second intervals 10 or more times in a row. The function of the calls is unknown.

Little is known about the reproductive biology of the Auckland rail. The few nests that have been found contained clutches of two eggs, probably laid in early November. The eggs are cream coloured with red, brown and grey spots.

The Auckland rail is highly secretive and was considered to be [extinct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinct) for many years before its rediscovery. The population of about 1500 birds is currently stable on the two islands it survives on. It is thought to have become extinct on the main [Auckland Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland_Islands) due to the presence of introduced [feral cats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral_cat) and [pigs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig); it is hoped the eventual removal of these from the islands will allow for reintroductions to other islands in the group. The species is currently considered [vulnerable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species) by the [IUCN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN) and [BirdLife International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BirdLife_International) due to the possibility of rats or other predators reaching the two islands it survives on.
