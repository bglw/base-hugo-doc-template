The **New Zealand king shag** (_**Leucocarbo carunculatus**_), also known as the **rough-faced shag**, **king shag** or **kawau**, is a rare bird [endemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(ecology)) to New Zealand. Some taxonomic authorities, including the [International Ornithologists' Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Ornithologists%27_Union), place this species in the genus _[Leucocarbo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucocarbo)_. Others place it in the genus _[Phalacrocorax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalacrocorax)_.

Description
---------------

It is a large (76 cm long, 2.5 kg in weight) black and white [cormorant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cormorant) with pink feet. White patches on the wings appear as bars when the wings are folded. Yellow-orange swellings ([caruncles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caruncle_(bird_anatomy))) are found above the base of the bill. The grey [gular pouch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gular_pouch) is reddish in the breeding season. A blue eye-ring indicates its kinship with the other [blue-eyed shags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-eyed_shag).

Habitat
-----------

New Zealand king shags can be seen from the [Cook Strait ferries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_Strait#Transport) in [Queen Charlotte Sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Charlotte_Sound_(New_Zealand)) opposite the beginning of the Tory Channel. They live in the coastal waters of the [Marlborough Sounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlborough_Sounds) where they are known to breed only on rocky islets at [four small sites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlborough_Sounds_Important_Bird_Areas).
