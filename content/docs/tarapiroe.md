The **black-fronted tern** (_**Chlidonias albostriatus**_), also known as **sea martin**, **ploughboy**, **inland tern**, **riverbed tern** or **tarapiroe**,\[_[page needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources)_\] is a small [tern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tern) generally found in or near bodies of fresh water in New Zealand, where it forages for freshwater fish, arthropods and worms. It has a predominantly grey plumage. Restricted to breeding in the eastern regions of the [South Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Island), it is declining and threatened by introduced mammals and birds. It is rated as [endangered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered) on the [International Union for Conservation of Nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature) (IUCN)'s [Red List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List) of Threatened Species.

Taxonomy
------------

German naturalist [Johann Reinhold Forster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Reinhold_Forster) [described](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_description) the black-fronted tern from a specimen collected at [Queen Charlotte Sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Charlotte_Sound_(New_Zealand)), Marlborough in 1832, giving it the binomial name _Sterna antarctica_, however the name had already been used for the Antarctic tern by French naturalist [René Lesson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Lesson) the previous year.

The first valid description of the species was by [George Robert Gray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Robert_Gray) in 1845, who called it _Hydrochelidon albostriata_. Its specific name is derived from the [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin) _albus_ "white", and _striatus_ "striped". [Charles Lucien Bonaparte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Lucien_Bonaparte) spelled its species name _albistriata_ in 1856, which was adopted by subsequent authors until it was corrected by [Walter Oliver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Oliver) in 1955.

Its taxonomic placement was unclear for many years, as its plumage and migration inland to nest suggested it belonged with the [marsh terns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh_tern) of the genus _Chlidonias_ yet it did not nest in marshes like the other members of that genus. [Martin Moynihan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Moynihan) described it as "the most puzzling case", ultimately placing it in _Sterna_ as he suspected the similarity of its breeding plumage to that of _C. hybrida_ was due to similarity in environment and observed that the nonbreeding plumage resembled that of other members of _Sterna_. Gochfeld and Berger (1996) followed in keeping it in _Sterna_, while [Charles Sibley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sibley) and [Burt Monroe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burt_Monroe) placed it in _Chlidonias_. A 2005 molecular study by Bridge and colleagues placed it as a basal member of the marsh terns, settling the issue.

The species has several vernacular names. Gray noted in 1845 that the Maori called it _tarapiroe_. It is called ploughboy or ploughman's friend for its habit of foraging for earthworms and grubs in newly ploughed soil.

Description
---------------

Measuring 29 cm (12 in) in length, the adult tern has predominantly grey plumage with a black cap typical of many terns. The underparts and rump are white, and there is a thin white streak running along the cheeks underneath the cap. The bill is red and legs orange. The black cap recedes from the bill in non-breeding plumage and becomes flecked with white.

Distribution and habitat
----------------------------

Within New Zealand, the black-fronted tern is found from the southern tip of the [North Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Island), and along much of the eastern [South Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Island) from [Marlborough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlborough_Region) to [Southland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southland_Region), and to [Stewart Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Island/Rakiura). There is an outlying population along the [Buller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buller_River) and upper [Motueka Rivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motueka_River) in southern Nelson.

Breeding
------------

The breeding range is restricted to South Island only. It lives along riverbanks and can forage out to 10 km (6 mi) at sea in the nonbreeding season.

Fieldwork on the [Wairau River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wairau_River) in Marlbrorough showed that the [swamp harrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swamp_harrier) (_Circus approximans_) is a common raider of black-fronted tern nests for eggs, with the native [kelp gull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelp_gull) (_Larus dominicanus_) and [South Island oystercatchers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Island_oystercatcher) (_Haematopus finschi_) also raiding. Introduced mammals such as the cat (_Felis catus_), stoat (_Mustela erminea_), hedgehog (_Erinaceus europaeus occidentalis_) and black rat (_Rattus rattus_) have also been recorded.

Conservation
----------------

Numbers of black-fronted terns are decreasing across its range, and the species is classified as endangered. Threats include several species introduced to New Zealand - stoats (_[Mustela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustela)_ spp.), feral cats, the [brown rat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_rat) (_Rattus norvegicus_), hedgehog, dog, and from Australia, the [common brushtail possum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_brushtail_possum) (_Trichosurus vulpecula_), and [Australian magpie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_magpie) (_Gymnorhina tibicen_).
