The **Chatham pigeon** (_**Hemiphaga chathamensis**_), also called the **Chatham Island pigeon** or **parea,** is a [bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird) [endemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(ecology)) to the [Chatham Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_Islands) in [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand). Growing to 800g in weight and 55 cm in length, the Chatham Island pigeon is closely related to the [kererū](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerer%C5%AB) or New Zealand pigeon (_Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae_), the only other species in the genus _Hemiphaga_.

While rated vulnerable by [IUCN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN), it is considered critically threatened in New Zealand. Recovering from a low of 40 birds in the 1980s, the Chatham Island pigeon population is now over 600, and the species is ranked by the [IUCN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN) as "Vulnerable", and by the [New Zealand Department of Conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Conservation_(New_Zealand)) as at 2017 as "Threatened – Nationally Vulnerable".

The species is largely restricted to the southern forests of [Chatham Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_Island) (particularly those around the Tuku River). A few have been seen elsewhere on Chatham Island and also further afield on [Pitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitt_Island/Rangiauria) and [South East Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_East_Island/Rangatira). They were common in the 1870s but [habitat destruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_destruction) and predation by mammalian [invasive species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species) reduced the population to only 40 birds by 1990. Since then, predator control and stock fencing in and around the [Tuku valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuku_Nature_Reserve) have resulted in improved breeding success which has led to rapid population growth.

Traditionally considered a [subspecies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies) of the kereru, it was proposed in 2001 to be distinct enough to be raised to full [species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species) status.

Because the Chatham Islands have been separated from the mainland of New Zealand for so long, the Chatham pigeon has evolved differently from its mainland relative, the kererū. There are a number of differences between the two pigeons. The Chatham pigeon is around 20% heavier than the kererū and has a heavier bill. Unlike the kererū, the Chatham pigeon has an enlarged hind toe which helps it to scrabble about on the forest floor. The Chatham pigeon generally nests from June to October, while the kererū nests from September to January. The Chatham pigeon nests in bracken or fern near the ground while the kererū prefers to nest in a tree, out of harm's way. The Chatham pigeon's egg is also much bigger.

Chatham pigeon feed on the fruits of the hoho ([_Pseudopanax chathamicus_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudopanax)), [matipo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matipo), [mahoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melicytus_ramiflorus) and [karamu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprosma_robusta) tree, and the foliage of mahoe, hoho and [clover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clover). The succulent fruits of the hoho are especially sought after. They are at their best in August and September, which coincides with the peak of the Chatham pigeon's breeding season.

Chatham pigeon is renowned for their spectacular flying dives, especially by the males, to attract a mate. Most breed at 1 to 2 years of age, laying just one egg. Chicks fledge at about 45 days old and become independent at 3 months. They have a life expectancy of up to 25 years.
