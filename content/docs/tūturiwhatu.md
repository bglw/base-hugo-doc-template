The **New Zealand dotterel** (_**Charadrius obscurus**_) is a species of shorebird found only in certain areas of [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand). It is also called the **New Zealand plover** or **red-breasted dotterel**, and its [Māori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_language) names include _tūturiwhatu_, _pukunui_, and _kūkuruatu_.

The southern subspecies of the New Zealand plover is considered [critically endangered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critically_Endangered) and was nearing [extinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction) with about 75 individuals remaining in 1990. Conservation measures increased this to 250 by 2005, but a further decline has occurred since 2012 to an estimated 60–80 mature individuals in 2017.

Taxonomy and systematics
----------------------------

The first description of the species was provided by [Johann Gmelin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Friedrich_Gmelin) in the 1789 edition of _[Systema Naturae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systema_Naturae)_.

A 2015 study determined that its closest relatives are two other New Zealand plovers, the [wrybill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrybill), which was found to be in the _Charadrius_ clade, and the [double-banded plover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-banded_plover).

### Subspecies

Two [subspecies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies) are recognised, although a taxonomic review has supported recognition of tentative species status for each of the two populations and this was recognised in the _[Handbook of the Birds of the World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handbook_of_the_Birds_of_the_World)_ ([BirdLife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BirdLife), 2014) and in the conservation listing of the [IUCN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN).

*   [_C. o. obscurus_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_red-breasted_plover) - Gmelin, JF, 1789: Found on the [South Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Island) and [Stewart Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Island_/_Rakiura) (New Zealand)

Distribution and habitat
----------------------------

New Zealand dotterels are usually found in two [disjunct populations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjunct_distribution) in New Zealand, usually on sandy beaches and sand spits or feeding in tidal estuaries. The northern population occurs on the North Island and the southern population occurs at the southern end of the South Island and on Stewart Island/Rakiura.

Breeding
------------

Parents lay eggs in the spring and summer. They nest on beaches above the high tide mark, and the nest is just a shallow hole dug in the ground. The chicks hatch about 28 days after the eggs have been laid. Because the nests are on the ground, the chicks can walk the day they hatch. They are cared for by their parents but have to find their own food as the adults do not feed them. They can usually fly within 6–8 weeks.

Status
----------

The [IUCN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN), which treats the two subspecies as separate species, rates the northern subspecies as [Near Threatened](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_Threatened) and the southern subspecies as [Critically Endangered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critically_Endangered).

The population size of the southerly subspecies had been reduced to about 62 individual birds in 1990 and the first study of the population structure undertaken from 1988 to 1992 indicated their significant decline. Conservation measures were put in place involving the poisoning of [feral cats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral_cat) and rats and the population has gradually risen, with about 250 individuals being recorded in 2005. The northerly subspecies has a wider range and its population was about 1300 in 1989. It had recovered to about 1700 individuals by 2004 but only as a result of intensive management. Nesting on beaches, they are vulnerable to disturbance by people and their dogs. Since 2012, there has been a rapid decline in numbers in the southern population, with an estimated 60 to 80 mature individuals in 2017.

The northern subspecies has the conservation status of "Regionally Critical" in the [Wellington Region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington_Region).

In the [Hawke's Bay region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawke%27s_Bay_Region), the species was locally extinct from the late 19th century. However, in 1990 some birds were seen at the [Mahia Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81hia_Peninsula). Coastliine surveys conducted in 2011 and 2021 found that numbers in the region had more than doubled over the ten year period, with 222 birds counted in 2021.
