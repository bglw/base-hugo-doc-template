The **bushwren** (_**Xenicus longipes**_), also known as the **mātuhituhi** in [Māori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_language), was a very small and almost [flightless bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flightless_bird) that was endemic to [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand). It had three subspecies on each of the major islands of New Zealand, the [North Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Island), [South Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Island), and [Stewart Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Island) and nearby smaller islands. The species disappeared gradually after the introduction of invasive mammalian predators, last being seen on the North Island in 1955 and the South Island in 1968. Attempts were made to save the remaining population on small islands off Stewart Island, but they ultimately failed with the death of the last remaining known birds in 1972.

Taxonomy
------------

German naturalist [Johann Friedrich Gmelin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Friedrich_Gmelin) described the bushwren in 1789.

Description
---------------

It grew to about 9 cm long and 16 g in weight. It fed mostly on [invertebrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrate), which it captured by running along the branches of trees. It nested on or near the ground.

Extinction
--------------

It was widespread throughout the main islands of the country until the late 19th century when [mustelids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustelidae) were introduced and joined [rats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat) as [invasive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species) mammalian predators. The only authenticated reports of the [North Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Island) subspecies (_X. l. stokesi_) since 1900 were from the southern [Rimutaka Range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimutaka_Range) in 1918 and the [Ureweras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Te_Urewera) up to 1955, with probable sightings on June 13, 1949, near [Lake Waikareiti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Waikareiti), and several times in the first half of the 20th century in the [Huiarau Range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huiarau_Range) and from [Kapiti Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapiti_Island) in 1911. Apparently, the last population lived in the area where [Te Urewera National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Te_Urewera_National_Park) was established, just around the time of its extinction.

The last authenticated reports of the [South Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Island) subspecies (_X. l. longipes_) were from [Arthur's Pass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur%27s_Pass) in 1966 and [Nelson Lakes National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Lakes_National_Park) in 1968. There have been a few unsubstantiated reports since then from [Fiordland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiordland) and Nelson Lakes.

The third subspecies, the Stewart Island bushwren or Stead's bushwren (_X. l. variabilis_), was found on [Stewart Island/Rakiura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Island/Rakiura) and nearby islands. It is known to have survived on Stewart Island until 1951, but was probably exterminated there by [feral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral) [cats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat). It lived on , being reasonably common, until the early 1960s. It survived on predator-free [Big South Cape Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_South_Cape_Island) until [black rats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_rat) (_R. rattus_) invaded it in 1964. The [New Zealand Wildlife Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Wildlife_Service) attempted to save the species by relocating all the birds they could capture. They caught six birds and transferred them to , where they did not survive and they finally died out in 1972.
