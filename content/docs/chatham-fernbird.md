The **Chatham fernbird** (_Poodytes rufescens_) is an extinct bird species that was endemic to the [Chatham Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_Islands). It was historically known only from [Mangere Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangere_Island), but fossils have been found on [Pitt Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitt_Island) and [Chatham Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_Island) as well. Its closest living relative is the [New Zealand fernbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_fernbird) or matata (_Poodytes punctatus_). It was formerly treated as a subspecies of the New Zealand fernbird, but is now widely recognized as its own species. Both fernbirds were formerly placed in their own genus _Bowdleria_; they were later moved to _Megalurus_ and most recently _Poodytes_.

Description
---------------

The Chatham fernbird reached a length of 18 cm. Its wings were 5.9 to 6.7 cm. In contrast to the New Zealand fernbird, it had unspotted white underparts, a chestnut-brown crown, a distinct white loral spot, and a dark red-brown back. It was insectivorous but nothing more is known about its ecology.

Extinction
--------------

The first individual known to science was collected in 1868 by New Zealand naturalist Charles Traill on Mangere Island by "knocking it over with a stone". He sent it to Sir [Walter Buller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Buller), who described it as a new species in 1869. In 1871 the population was described\[_[by whom?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions)_\] as rather common on Mangere but reduced on Pitt Island. The reasons for its extinction were apparently brush fires, [overgrazing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overgrazing) by goats and rabbits and predation by rats and feral cats. The last specimen was shot for the collection of [Lionel Walter Rothschild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Walter_Rothschild) in 1895 shortly after the introduction of cats to Mangere Island, and it was regarded as extinct by 1900.
