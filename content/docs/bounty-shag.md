The **Bounty shag** (_**Leucocarbo ranfurlyi**_), also known as the **Bounty Island shag**, is a species of [cormorant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cormorant) of the family [Phalacrocoracidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalacrocoracidae). They are found only on the tiny and remote Subantarctic [Bounty Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounty_Islands), 670 km southeast of [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand). Its natural [habitats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat) are open seas and rocky shores. In 2005 618 individuals were counted (with roughly 410 mature ones) and the population seems to have remained stable since.

Some taxonomic authorities, including the [International Ornithologists' Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Ornithologists%27_Union), place this species in the genus _[Leucocarbo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucocarbo)_. Others place it in the genus _[Phalacrocorax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalacrocorax)_.

Description
---------------

Size; 71 cm. Large, black-and-white cormorant. Black head, hind neck, lower back, rump, uppertail-coverts, all with metallic blue sheen. White underparts. Pink feet. White patches on wings appear as bar when folded. [Caruncles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caruncle_(bird_anatomy)) absent. Voice: Male makes call during displays only.

[IUCN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN) classifies this species as [Vulnerable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species) because its very small population and breeding range renders it susceptible to [stochastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic) events and human impacts. The Bounty Islands are a nature reserve and are free of introduced predators. In 1998, they were declared part of a [UNESCO World Heritage Site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO_World_Heritage_Site). The islands are uninhabited and are seldom visited, so human interference is minimal.
