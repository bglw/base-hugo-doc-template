The **Fiordland penguin** (_**Eudyptes pachyrhynchus**_), also known as the **Fiordland** **crested penguin** (in [Māori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_language), _**tawaki**_ or **pokotiwha**), is a [crested penguin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crested_penguin) species [endemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism) to [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand). It currently breeds along the south-western coasts of [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand)'s [South Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Island) as well as on [Stewart Island/Rakiura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Island/Rakiura) and its outlying islands. Because it originally ranged beyond [Fiordland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiordland), it is sometimes referred to as the **New Zealand crested penguin**.

Taxonomy
------------

The Fiordland crested penguin was described in 1845 by English zoologist [George Robert Gray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Robert_Gray), its specific epithet derived from the [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek) _pachy-_/παχυ- "thick" and _rhynchos_/ρύγχος "beak". It is one of six species in the genus _Eudyptes_, the generic name derived from the Ancient Greek _eu_/ευ "good" and _dyptes_/δύπτης "diver".

Description
---------------

This species is a medium-sized, yellow-crested, black-and-white penguin, growing to approximately 60 cm (24 in) long and weighing on average 3.7 kg (8.2 lb), with a weight range of 2 to 5.95 kg (4.4 to 13.1 lb). It has dark, bluish-grey upperparts with a darker head, and white underparts. Its broad, yellow eyebrow-stripe extends over the eye and drops down the neck. It can be distinguished from the similar [erect-crested penguin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erect-crested_penguin) (_Eudyptes sclateri_) and [Snares penguin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snares_penguin) (_Eudyptes robustus_) in having no bare skin around the base of its bill. Female Fiordland penguins lay a clutch of two eggs where the first-laid egg is much smaller than the second egg, generally hatches later, and shows higher mortality, demonstrating a brood reduction system that is unique from other avian groups.

Distribution and habitat
----------------------------

This penguin nests in colonies among tree roots and rocks in dense temperate coastal forest. It breeds along the shores in the West Coast of the South Island, south of about [Bruce Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Bay) and the [Open Bay Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Bay_Islands), around [Fiordland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiordland) and [Foveaux Strait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foveaux_Strait), and on [Stewart Island/Rakiura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Island/Rakiura) and its outlying islands. Fossils of this species have been found as far north as the northern end of the South Island, and they probably once nested in the North Island as well. [Other remains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Island_penguin) found in a 13th century [Aboriginal Tasmanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_Tasmanian) [midden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midden) in [Hunter Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Island_(Tasmania)) evidence that they formerly occurred out of New Zealand, as well. Their range drastically reduced by hunting in Polynesian times, and they are now only found in the least-populated part of New Zealand.

Diet
--------

The main prey species reported are cephalopods (85%, mainly [arrow squid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nototodarus_sloanii), _Nototodarus sloanii_), followed by crustaceans (13%, primarily [krill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krill), ) and fish (2%, mainly [red cod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_codling) and [hoki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_grenadier)). However, the importance of cephalopods might be exaggerated. Prey taken seems to vary between Codfish Island and northern Fiordland.

Conservation
----------------

Fiordland crested penguins are classed as vulnerable to extinction by the [IUCN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature), and their status was changed from vulnerable to endangered by the [Department of Conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Conservation_(New_Zealand)) in 2013. Surveys in the 1990s counted 2,500 pairs, though this was likely an underestimate; based on historic trends, the population is probably continuing to decline. The main threats are introduced predators such dogs, cats, [rats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat), and especially [stoats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoat). They are also vulnerable to human disturbance, fleeing nests and leaving chicks exposed to predators.
