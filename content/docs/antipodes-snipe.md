The **Antipodes snipe** (_**Coenocorypha aucklandica meinertzhagenae**_), also known as the **Antipodes Island snipe**, is an isolated [subspecies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies) of the [Subantarctic snipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subantarctic_snipe) that is [endemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism) to the [Antipodes Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipodes_Islands), a [subantarctic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subantarctic) island group south of [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand) in the [Southern Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ocean).

Taxonomy and etymology
--------------------------

The Antipodes Island snipe was first collected by Fairchild in 1887, and by [Andreas Reischek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Reischek) in 1888. It was first described by Walter Rothschild in 1893 as _Gallinago tristrami_ in honour of [Henry Baker Tristram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Baker_Tristram). However, doubts were raised about the provenance of the type specimen, which appeared to be from the Auckland Islands, and Rothschild made a new description in 1927, recognising the Antipodes Island form as a subspecies of _Coenocorypha aucklandica_. The subspecific name honours [British](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) [ornithologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornithology) [Annie Meinertzhagen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Meinertzhagen), the second wife of ornithologist [Richard Meinertzhagen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Meinertzhagen).

Description
---------------

The Antipodes Island snipe is similar to the nominate subspecies – the [Auckland Island snipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland_snipe) – but differs in being darker above and with yellower underparts.

Distribution and habitat
----------------------------

The snipe is endemic to the Antipodes group, which has a total surface area of 22 km2 (8.5 sq mi). It has been recorded not only from the main Antipodes Island, but also from the much smaller [Bollons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollons_Island), Archway and Inner Windward Islands. It inhabits the islands’ [tussock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tussock_(grass)) [grasslands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassland) and [herbfields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbfield), nesting under tussocks and _[Polystichum vestitum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polystichum_vestitum)_ shield ferns.

Behaviour
-------------

### Breeding

Breeding is seasonal, with egg-laying beginning in mid to late August. The typical clutch size is two. “[Hakawai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakawai_(mythology))” aerial displays have been recorded.

### Feeding

The snipe have been recorded as feeding on a variety of invertebrates, including [annelids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annelid), [amphipods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphipod), [isopods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isopod), [arachnids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachnid) and [insects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect).

Status and conservation
---------------------------

The population of the snipe is estimated at 8,000 birds. It has been classified as a range-restricted island endemic with a stable population.
