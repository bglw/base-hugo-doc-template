**Dieffenbach's rail** (_Hypotaenidia dieffenbachii_) is an [extinct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinct) [flightless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flightless) species of [bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird) from the family [Rallidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rallidae). It was [endemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic) to the [Chatham Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_Islands) and referred to as meriki, or mehoriki, by the indigenous [Moriori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moriori). The only recorded living specimen of Dieffenbach's rail was captured in 1840 by [Ernst Dieffenbach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Dieffenbach), who is commemorated in the scientific and common name of the species. It became [extinct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinct) due to hunting and introduced predators, perhaps soon after 1840.

The Dieffenbach's rail was [sympatric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympatric) with the flightless [Chatham rail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_rail). Their sympatry suggests parallel evolution after separate colonisation of the [Chatham Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_Islands) by a common volant ancestor, presumably the [buff-banded rail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buff-banded_rail) (_Hypotaenidia philippensis_). A 2014 genetic analysis found that the taxa were not particularly closely related, with Dieffenbach's rail being sister to the group of _Hypotaenidia_ including the Buff-banded rail, while the Chatham rail was found to be in a more basal position.
