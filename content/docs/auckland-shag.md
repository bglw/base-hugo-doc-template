The **Auckland shag** (_**Leucocarbo colensoi**_) or Auckland Islands shag is a species of [cormorant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cormorant) from [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand). The species is [endemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism) to the [Auckland Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland_Islands) archipelago. It is a sedentary bird that primarily eats various crustaceans and fish. In recent years, roughly 1,000 pairs have been recorded. The Auckland shag is a colonial nester, building sizeable nests of, among other items, grass, twigs and seaweed. The Auckland shag lays three pale blue-green eggs in November–February. The [incubation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_incubation) period is 26–32 days.

The Auckland shag is considered [Vulnerable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species) by the [IUCN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN) due to its small population size and restricted global range.

Some taxonomic authorities, including the [International Ornithologists' Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Ornithologists%27_Union), place this species in the genus [Leucocarbo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucocarbo). Others place it in the genus [Phalacrocorax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalacrocorax).

The binomial name of this bird commemorates the naturalist [William Colenso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Colenso).
