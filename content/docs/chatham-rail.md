The **Chatham rail** (_Cabalus modestus_) is an [extinct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinct) [flightless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flightless) species of [bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird) in the family [Rallidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rallidae). It was [endemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic) to [Chatham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_Island), [Mangere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangere_Island) and [Pitt Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitt_Island), in the [Chatham archipelago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_Islands) of [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand).

The Chatham rail and the [Dieffenbach's rail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieffenbach%27s_rail), both flightless, were [sympatric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympatric) on the [Chatham Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_Islands). Their sympatry suggests [parallel evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_evolution) after separate colonisation of the Chatham Islands by a common volant ancestor. A genetic analysis from 1997 suggested that the two were [sister taxa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_group). However more recent genetic analysis finds them to not be closely related within the _Gallirallus_ radition, with a 2014 analysis finding the Chatham rail being sister taxon to the [New Caledonian rail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Caledonian_rail) instead.

The Chatham rail was first discovered on Mangere in 1871, and 26 specimens collected there are known from museum collections. It became extinct on the island between 1896 and 1900. The species is also known from 19th century bones from Chatham and Pitt Islands. It is likely to have occurred in [scrubland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrubland) and [tussock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tussock_(grass)) grass.

Extinction
--------------

Its extinction was presumably caused by predation by rats and cats (which were introduced in the 1890s), [habitat destruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_destruction) to provide [sheep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep) pasture (which destroyed all the island's bush and [tussock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tussock_(grass)) grass by 1900), and from grazing by goats and rabbits. On Chatham and Pitt Islands, Olson has suggested that its extinction resulted from competition with the larger [Dieffenbach's rail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieffenbach%27s_rail) (also extinct), but this has been refuted later when the two species have been shown to have been [sympatric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympatric) on Mangere.
