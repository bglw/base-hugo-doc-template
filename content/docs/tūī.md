The **tūī** (_Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae_) is a boisterous medium-sized bird native to New Zealand. It is blue, green, and bronze colored with a distinctive white throat tuft. It is an [endemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism) [passerine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine) bird of [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand), and the only species in the [genus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus) _**Prosthemadera**_. It is one of the largest species in the diverse Australasian [honeyeater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeyeater) family Meliphagidae, and one of two living species of that family found in New Zealand, the other being the [New Zealand bellbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_bellbird) (_Anthornis melanura_). The tūī has a wide distribution in the archipelago, ranging from the subtropical [Kermadec Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kermadec_Islands) to the sub-Antarctic [Auckland Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland_Islands), as well as the main islands.

Taxonomy
------------

The bird's name comes from the [Māori language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_language). The plural is _tūī_ in modern [New Zealand English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_English), or _ngā tūī_ in Māori usage; some speakers still use the '-s' suffix to produce the Anglicised form _tūīs_ to indicate plurality, but this practice is becoming less common. For many years the prevailing spelling was _tui_ without the [macrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macron_(diacritic)) that indicate long vowels, but spelling Māori [loanwords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loanword) with macrons is now common in [New Zealand English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_English). The [International Ornithologists' Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Ornithologists%27_Union) (IOC), which has a policy of not using [accents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic), lists _Tui_ as the bird's English name. Early European colonists called it the _parson bird_ or _mockingbird_ but these names are no longer used.

The closest living relative to tūī is the [New Zealand bellbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_bellbird); genetic analysis indicates its ancestor diverged from a lineage that gave rise to the New Zealand and Chatham bellbirds around 5 million years ago. The [cladogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladogram) below shows this relationship:

Description
---------------

The tūī is a large honeyeater, 27 to 32 cm (11–13 in) in length. The Chatham Islands subspecies is larger on average than the nominate subspecies, and heavier. Males tend to be heavier than females. Nominate males weigh between 65–150 g (2.3–5.3 oz), and females 58–105 g (2.0–3.7 oz). Males of the Chatham subspecies are 89–240 g (3.1–8.5 oz) and females 89–170 g (3.1–6.0 oz).

At first glance the bird appears completely black except for a small tuft of white feathers at its neck and a small white wing patch, causing it to resemble a [parson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parson) in clerical attire. On closer inspection (see image) it can be seen that tūī have brown feathers on the back and flanks, a multicoloured [iridescent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridescent) sheen that varies with the angle from which the light strikes them, and a dusting of small, white-shafted feathers on the back and sides of the neck that produce a lacy collar.

Distribution and habitat
----------------------------

Tūī are native to New Zealand, and are found throughout the country, particularly the [North Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Island), the west and south coasts of the [South Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Island), [Stewart Island/Rakiura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Island/Rakiura) and the [Chatham Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_Islands), where an endangered sub-species particular to these islands exists. Other populations live on [Raoul Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Island) in the [Kermadecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kermadec_Islands), and in the [Auckland Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland_Islands) (where, with the [New Zealand bellbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_bellbird), it is the most southerly species of honeyeater). Traditionally, Māori ate tūī that had been preserved in [calabashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabash) or gourds. Populations have declined considerably since European settlement, mainly as a result of widespread [habitat destruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_destruction) and predation by [mammalian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal) [invasive species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species).

Nonetheless, the species is considered secure and has made recoveries in some areas, particularly after removal of livestock has allowed vegetation to recover. Predation by [introduced species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduced_species) remains a threat, particularly [brushtail possums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_brushtail_possum_in_New_Zealand) (which eat eggs and chicks), cats, [stoats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoat), the [common myna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_myna) (which competes with tūī for food and sometimes takes eggs), blackbirds, and rats.

Tūī prefer [broadleaf forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadleaf_forest) at low altitudes, although have been recorded up to 1500 metres. They will tolerate quite small remnant patches, regrowth, exotic plantations and well-vegetated suburbs. They are one of the most common birds found in urban [Wellington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington). Tūī are usually seen singly, in pairs, or in small family groups, but will congregate in large numbers at suitable food sources, often in company with [silvereyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvereye), bellbirds, or [kererū](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerer%C5%AB) (New Zealand pigeon) in any combination. Generally, when [interspecific competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interspecific_competition) for the same food resources among New Zealand's two species of honeyeater occurs, there is a hierarchy with the tūī at the top and bellbirds subordinate. The latter are thus frequently chased off by tūī at a food source such as a flowering [flax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phormium) plant.

Behaviour and ecology
-------------------------

Male tūī can be extremely aggressive, chasing all other birds (large and small) from their [territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_(animal)) with loud flapping and sounds akin to rude human speech. This is especially true of other tūī when possession of a favoured feeding tree is impinged. Birds will often erect their body feathers in order to appear larger in an attempt to intimidate a rival. They have even been known to [mob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobbing_(animal_behavior)) [harriers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swamp_harrier) and [magpies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_magpies_in_New_Zealand).

The powered flight of tūī is quite loud as they have developed short wide wings, giving excellent maneuverability in the dense forest they prefer, but requiring rapid flapping. They can be seen to perform a mating display of rising at speed in a vertical climb in clear air, before stalling and dropping into a powered dive, then repeating. Much of this behaviour is more notable during the breeding season of early spring—September and October. Females alone build nests of twigs, grasses and mosses.

### Feeding

[Nectar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nectar) is the normal diet but fruit and insects are frequently eaten, and [pollen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollen) and seeds more occasionally. Particularly popular is the [New Zealand flax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_flax), whose nectar sometimes [ferments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermentation_(food)), resulting in the tūī flying in a fashion that suggests that they might be drunk. They are the main [pollinators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollinator) of [flax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phormium), [kōwhai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dwhai), [kaka beak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaka_beak) and some other plants. Note that the flowers of the three plants mentioned are similar in shape to the tūī's beak—a vivid example of [mutualistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutualism_(biology)) [coevolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coevolution).

### Songs and calls

Tūī are known for their noisy, unusual, sometimes soulful calls, different for each individual, that combine [bellbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_bellbird)\-like notes with clicks, cackles, timber-like creaks and groans, and wheezing sounds.

Tūī have a complex variety of songs and calls, much like [parrots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrot). They also resemble parrots in their ability to clearly imitate human speech, and were trained by Māori to replicate complex speech. They also re-create sounds like glass shattering, car alarms, classical music and advertising jingles.

All birds have a sound producing organ called a [syrinx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrinx_(bird_anatomy)), which is typically controlled with two sets of muscles. Songbirds or [passerines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine) like tūī have nine pairs of muscles giving them the ability to produce much more complex [vocalisations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_vocalization), and they can be seen to be very physically involved with their songs. Their dual voice box allow tūī to make two sounds at the same time. Tūī song also exhibits geographical, microgeographic, seasonal, sex and individual variation.

Some of the wide range of tūī sounds are beyond the [human register](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_hearing). Watching a tūī sing, one can observe gaps in audible sound when the beak is agape and throat tufts throbbing. Hill (2011) describes these apparent gaps in the song, but notes that the audio recording equipment used in the research was not capable of detecting [ultrasound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound) above a frequency of 22.1 kHz. Tūī will also sing at night, especially around the full moon period.<ref>Paul, R. St & H. R.
