The **tomtit** (_Petroica macrocephala_) is a small [passerine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine) bird in the [family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)) [Petroicidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroicidae), the Australasian robins. It is [endemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(ecology)) to the islands of [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand), ranging across the main islands as well as several of the [outlying islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_outlying_islands). In [Māori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_language), the North Island Tomtit is known as **miromiro** and the South Island Tomtit is known as **ngirungiru**. This bird has several other [Māori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_language) and [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language) names as well. There are several [subspecies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies) showing considerable variation in [plumage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage) and size. The species is not threatened and has adapted to the changes made to New Zealand's [biodiversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity_of_New_Zealand).

Etymology
-------------

The term _tomtit_ was originally a shortened form of _tom titmouse_. Either form has been used to describe a number of small birds, but in England _tomtit_ was most commonly used as an alternate name of the [blue tit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_tit). The word [tit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_(bird)) is today used for a number of small birds, especially of the family [Paridae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paridae). Originally, it was used for any small animal or object.

Taxonomy and evolution
--------------------------

The tomtit is one of four species of the [genus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus) _[Petroica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroica)_ found in New Zealand, the ancestors of which colonised from [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia). The species was once thought to have been descended from the [scarlet robin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlet_robin), although more recent research has questioned this. It seems likely that there were two colonisation events, with the North Island robin and the South Island robin descended from one event, and the [black robin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_robin) and tomtit from another.

There are five subspecies of the tomtit, with each subspecies being restricted to one of the following islands or island groups: North Island, South Island, the Snares Islands, the Chatham Islands, and the Auckland Islands. Four of these five subspecies have been elevated to full species in the past (the Chatham subspecies was retained with the South Island tomtit), but genetic studies have shown that these subspecies diverged relatively recently.

Description
---------------

The tomtit is a small (13 cm, 11 g) bird with a large head and a short [bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak). The male [North Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Island) subspecies has black head, back, wings (with a white wing-bar), and a white belly. The subspecies from [South Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Island), the [Chatham Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_Islands), and [Auckland Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland_Islands) are similar, but have a yellow band across the breast between the black head and white belly. The females are brown instead of black. The [Snares Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snares_Island) subspecies is entirely black, and is known as the black tit.

The island subspecies of tomtits show a striking variation in body size, being considerably larger than their mainland relatives, a tendency known as the [Foster's rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foster%27s_rule) or the island effect. Birds from the main islands weigh around 11g, compared with birds from Snares Island, which weigh in at 20 g.

Behaviour
-------------

The tomtit is mostly an [insectivore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insectivore), feeding on small invertebrates, such as [beetles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beetle), caterpillars, [spiders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider), [moths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moth), [wētā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C4%93t%C4%81), [earthworms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthworm), and flies. Fruit is taken during the winter and autumn. Most subspecies feed in vegetation, waiting on a perch and watching for [prey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prey). [Insects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect) are also gleaned from branches and leaves. The Snares subspecies feeds on the ground as well, in a similar fashion to the [North](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Island_robin) or [South Island robins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Island_robin).
