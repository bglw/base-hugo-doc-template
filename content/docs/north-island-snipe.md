The **North Island snipe** (_**Coenocorypha barrierensis**_), also known as the **little barrier snipe** or **tutukiwi**, is an [extinct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction) species of [bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird) in the [sandpiper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandpiper) [family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)), Scolopacidae, that was [endemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic) to [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand).

Taxonomy and etymology
--------------------------

Examination of the taxonomy of _Coenocorypha_ snipe has been hindered by lack of material, erroneous locality data, misidentified specimens and confused nomenclature. The North Island snipe was described in 1955 by [Walter Oliver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Oliver) as a subspecies of the [Subantarctic snipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subantarctic_snipe) (_Coenocorypha aucklandica_), but has since been elevated to a full species, with fossil material from the North Island referred to it. The [specific epithet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_name_(zoology)) and older common name refer to the [type locality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_locality_(biology)).

Distribution and extinction
-------------------------------

The North Island snipe is extinct. Its prehistoric distribution comprised the [North Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Island) where subfossil remains have been found in several places. It became extinct on the mainland of North Island following the occupation of New Zealand by [Polynesians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynesians) (the ancestors of the [Māori people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_people)) and the associated introduction of [Pacific rats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_rat) (_Rattus exulans_). It survived on at least one small island, [Little Barrier Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Barrier_Island) in the [Hauraki Gulf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hauraki_Gulf), until 1870 where the [type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_(biology)#Type_specimen) (and only existing) specimen was taken. According to Oliver, “About 1870 two snipe were seen on Little Barrier Island by Captain Bennett of the schooner _Mary Ann_. One was captured alive but died in captivity, the other escaped. The captured specimen was presented to the Auckland Museum by Mr T.B. Hill and is the basis of the following account.”

Description
---------------

Oliver described the North Island snipe as being generally similar to other _Coenocorypha_ snipes. He added that it differed from the [South Island snipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Island_snipe) in the “greater area of buffy white on chin and throat, the absence of bars on the lower abdomen, the crescent-shaped markings on the upper abdomen and the less rufous general coloration”.
