The **yellowhead** or **mōhua** (_Mohoua ochrocephala_) is a small insectivorous [passerine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine) bird [endemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism) to the [South Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Island) of [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand). Once a common forest bird, its numbers declined drastically after the introduction of [rats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_rat) and [stoats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoat), and it is now endangered.

Name
--------

The yellowhead was known in the 19th century as the "bush canary", after its trilling song. Today it often goes by its [Māori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_language) name mōhua in [New Zealand English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_English), but Māori also knew it as _mōhoua_ and _houa_. Recent classification places this species and its close relative, the [whitehead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehead_(bird)), in the family [Mohouidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohoua).

Distribution
----------------

The yellowhead and the whitehead have [allopatric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allopatric) distributions as, conversely, the latter is found only in the [North Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Island) and several small islands surrounding it. Although abundant in the 19th century, particularly in [southern beech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Beech) forests on the [South Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Island) and [Stewart Island/Rakiura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Island/Rakiura), mōhua declined dramatically in the early 20th century due to the introduction of [black rats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rattus_rattus) and [mustelids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustelid); nesting in tree holes makes them more vulnerable to predators.

Today they have vanished from almost all of the South Island's forests and exist in less than 5% of their original range. On mainland South Island there is currently a small population of mōhua in the [Marlborough Sounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlborough_Sounds) and around [Arthur's Pass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur%27s_Pass_(mountain_pass)), but a quarter of the population lives in the beech forests of [the Catlins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Catlins). The mōhua number about 5000.

Conservation
----------------

In New Zealand, mōhua have the status of a _protected threatened endemic_ species. Conservation efforts are being made to ensure its survival and mōhua populations have been established on several predator-free offshore islands, such as [Breaksea Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaksea_Island_(New_Zealand)) in [Fiordland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiordland) and [Ulva Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulva_Island,_New_Zealand). Birds have been captive-bred at [Orana Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orana_Park) in [Christchurch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christchurch).

In 2003, 39 mōhua were translocated from Breaksea Island to predator-free [Whenua Hōu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codfish_Island) / Codfish Island, and more were introduced to Whenua Hōu from the Catlins in 2018, increasing the island's population to about 1000. More releases are planned to islands in Fiordland.

Pest control efforts by the [Department of Conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Department_of_Conservation) have managed to stabilise some mainland mōhua populations. For example, where [biodegradable 1080 poison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_fluoroacetate) was used to control rats in the [Dart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dart_River_(Otago)) valley, there was a more than 80% survival rate, compared with just 10% in untreated areas. The population of mōhua in the [Landsborough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landsborough_River) valley has increased four-fold since 1998, thanks to an intensive programme of pest control, including aerial 1080. The population is now strong enough for birds to be transferred out to establish a new population on [Resolution Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolution_Island,_New_Zealand).\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)_\] Similar aerial 1080 operations in the Catlins and the [Hurunui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurunui_River), [Hawdon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawdon_River) and [Eglinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eglinton_River) valleys have had equally encouraging results. [DOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Department_of_Conservation) and [TBfree New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Health_Board_(New_Zealand)) noted in March 2014 that there was a significant repopulation in the Catlins of other avian species, including [bellbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_bellbird) and [tomtit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomtit) due to the reduction of predators.

Popular culture
-------------------

Since the redesign of New Zealand's currency in 1991 a yellowhead has appeared on the reverse side of the [New Zealand $100 note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_one_hundred-dollar_note).
