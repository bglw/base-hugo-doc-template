The **Auckland teal**, **Auckland Islands teal** or **brown teal** (_Anas aucklandica_) is a species of [dabbling duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dabbling_duck) of the genus _Anas_ that is [endemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(ecology)) to [Auckland Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland_Islands) south of [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand). The species was once found throughout the Auckland Islands but is now restricted to the islands that lack introduced predators: [Adams Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adams_Island,_New_Zealand), [Enderby Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enderby_Island,_New_Zealand), [Disappointment Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappointment_Island) and a few smaller islands. An old report of "the same flightless duck" on North East Island, [The Snares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Snares) group most likely refers to a straggler.

The Auckland teal is smaller and rarer than the [brown teal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_teal) of the main islands of New Zealand, a species with which it was once considered [conspecific.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspecificity) The [plumage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage) is all over brown with a hint of green on the neck and a conspicuous white eyering. The female is slightly darker than the male. The wings are very small and the species has, like the related [Campbell teal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_teal), lost the power of [flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_flight).

The Auckland teal is mostly [crepuscular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crepuscular) to [nocturnal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnal_animal), preferring to hide from predators ([New Zealand falcons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_falcon) and [skuas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skua)) during the day. The species inhabits a variety of habitats with the islands, including tussock fields, mega herb shrubland and coastal waters. It is carnivorous for the most part, feeding on marine invertebrates, [insects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect), [amphipods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphipod) and other small Invertebrates. Auckland teal are territorial and seldom form flocks.
